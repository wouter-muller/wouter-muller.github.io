          ##  ABOUT ME

          I am a very experienced (10+ years) Senior/Lead Front-end Developer that learned a lot in Berlin, the tech/startup capital of Europe. Currently I am based in Groningen, the Netherlands.

          - I have a strong focus and a clear vision on topics like front-end architecture, clean/readable/maintainable code and following conventions and best practices
          - I enjoy taking and/or being involved in long-term strategic decisions and always try to have the "bird's eye" view
          - I am a big fan of VueJS and think it embodies the best features of React while remaining simple and intuitive to use
          - I have worked with Angular, React and VueJS and feel like chosing which framework/library to use is an important decision that should not be taken lightly, depending on the type and complexity of the web application you are trying to build.
          - I don't just focus on getting things done, but it is very important to me to get things done the right way
          - I strongly value principles like DRY, KISS, separation of concerns and progressive enhancement
          - I have advanced knowledge of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
          - It is important to me to keep up with evolving web standards, conventions and best practices
          - I am excited about CSS Grid and custom properties
          - I value code review processes like pull requests and see it as an excellent way to learn from each other and keep the quality of the code base high
          - I am very passionate about creating great user experiences that look amazing and are easy to use
