          ##  ABOUT ME

          - I don't just focus on getting things done, but it is very important to me to get things done <b>the right way</b>
          - I believe technical debt is the cancer of software development and should be avoided when at all possible
          - I love working with SASS and HAML to keep things readable and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)
          - I value writing clean and maintainable code
          - I am a strong supporter of the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle
          - I have advanced knowledge of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
          - It is important to me to keep up with evolving web standards, conventions and best practices
          - I try to avoid using heavy libraries/frameworks when not needed while strongly believing in the value of progressive enhancement
          - I value code review processes like pull requests and see it as an excellent way to learn from each other and keep the quality of the code base high
          - I am very passionate about creating great user experiences
